### 1. What is an Operator and Relational Operators with Symbols

**Operator**: 
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform a specific mathematical, logical, or relational operation and produce a result. Operators work on operands (data values) to perform the desired computation.

**Relational Operators**: 
Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return either `true` or `false` based on the comparison result.

| **Operator** | **Description**                        | **Example**          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `==`         | Equal to                              | `$a == $b` (true if $a is equal to $b) |
| `!=`         | Not equal to                          | `$a != $b` (true if $a is not equal to $b) |
| `>`          | Greater than                          | `$a > $b` (true if $a is greater than $b) |
| `<`          | Less than                             | `$a < $b` (true if $a is less than $b) |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to              | `$a >= $b` (true if $a is greater than or equal to $b) |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to                 | `$a <= $b` (true if $a is less than or equal to $b) |

### 2. Difference Between Binary and Unary Operators

- **Binary Operator**: Requires **two operands** to perform an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction). Example: `$a + $b` (adds two numbers).
  
- **Unary Operator**: Requires **only one operand** to perform an operation. Example: `-$a` (negates the value of `$a`).

**Example:**
- **Binary Operator**: `$x + $y` (requires two operands).
- **Unary Operator**: `- $x` (requires one operand).

### 3. What is a Preceding Operator?

The **preceding operator** concept refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Some operators have a higher precedence than others, meaning they are executed before operators with lower precedence. For example, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, so in the expression `$a + $b * $c`, the multiplication happens first.

**Example:**
```php
$x = 5 + 3 * 2; // Here * (multiplication) is executed before + (addition).
```

### 4. What is BODMAS Operation?

**BODMAS** stands for **Brackets, Orders (powers and roots), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction**. It refers to the order in which mathematical operations are performed to get the correct result.

**Order of Operations**:
1. **B**: Brackets first.
2. **O**: Orders (i.e., powers and roots, such as squaring).
3. **DM**: Division and Multiplication (from left to right).
4. **AS**: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

**Example**:
```php
$x = 3 + (2 * 5); // Parentheses first, then multiplication, then addition.
```

### 5. Difference Between `=`, `==`, and `===` Operators

- **`=` (Assignment Operator)**: 
  This operator is used to **assign a value** to a variable.

  **Example**:
  ```php
  $x = 5; // Assigns the value 5 to the variable $x.
  ```

- **`==` (Equality Operator)**: 
  This operator is used to **compare two values** for equality, but it does not check for type. It only checks if the values are the same.

  **Example**:
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  $y = "5";
  var_dump($x == $y); // true (values are the same, types are not compared).
  ```

- **`===` (Strict Equality Operator)**: 
  This operator checks for **both value and type**. The comparison will only return `true` if both the value and the type of the operands are the same.

  **Example**:
  ```php
  $x = 5;
  $y = "5";
  var_dump($x === $y); // false (values are the same, but types are different).
  ```

In summary:
- `=`: Assigns a value.
- `==`: Compares value only (ignores type).
- `===`: Compares both value and type.
