1. **What is the value of the expression 4 * 2 + 3?**
   - **Answer**: a) 11  
   **Explanation**: According to operator precedence, multiplication is performed first:  
   `4 * 2 = 8`, and then `8 + 3 = 11`.

2. **The logical And (&&) operator returns TRUE if _________**
   - **Answer**: c) The left and right operands both return a value true is true  
   **Explanation**: The `&&` (logical AND) operator returns true only if both operands are true.

3. **Which arithmetic operator can be used as both prefix and postfix operators?**

5. **What value is assigned to the $ReturnValue variable in the statement $ReturnValue = 100 != 200;**
   - **Answer**: a) True  
   **Explanation**: The `!=` operator checks if `100` is not equal to `200`. Since this is true, the Boolean value `true` is assigned to `$ReturnValue`.

6. **Which of the following is an example of initializing a variable?**
   - **Answer**: a) $num = 2;  
   **Explanation**: Initializing a variable means assigning a value to it for the first time, as in `$num = 2;`.

7. **A relational operator is used to:**
   - **Answer**: d) Compare the values

8. **Operators are used to perform some operation on the ________.**
   - **Answer**: a) Operands  
   **Explanation**: Operands are the values or variables upon which operators perform operations (e.g., in `4 + 3`, `4` and `3` are operands).
